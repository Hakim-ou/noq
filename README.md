# NoQ
Our objective, through this project, is to release people from queues; the amount of time they spend on them and the stress they
suffer while queuing. The idea is simple: the service owner generates a QR-code for his client, the client scans the QR-code and our job is to keep him informed of
the state of the queue, especially how many people are waiting before him, and in the future how much time approximatly he will have to wait (if you are
interested in this part and have some ideas about it, feel free to contact us. here are our Linkedin acounts.

The application is a native (of course!) android application written in Java for the moment. noubty-client-ig is the android app that the client will use, and
noubty-service-ig is the app that the service owner will use. noubty-api is an API, written in PHP, that manages the database.
